Note that `confused.js` is assumed to be an es module because it uses `import`.  However, it tries to export using CJS conventions.

As expected(?), webpack is locked into es module mode, and attempting to import the CJS export gets a `not found` warning.

  1 Verify that mixing es imports with cjs exports is a bad idea

WARNING in ./import-from-mixed-source.js

webpack still handles es/cjs files admirably, so long as you don't mix the two styles inside a single file.
